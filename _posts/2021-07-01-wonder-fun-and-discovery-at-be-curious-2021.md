The University’s family-friendly annual research open event goes online this year, giving an in-depth look into research conducted at Leeds from the luxury of participants’ own homes.

Launching on Monday 5 July, the 10-day festival promises to deliver nonstop fun and exploration through both the Be Curious family programme and the newly introduced Be Curious LATES series, which lines up exclusive talks just for grown-ups.

The event has been curated around the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to showcase how research at Leeds is “making a world of a difference”. It calls upon people from all age groups to consume this research by engaging with the live online activities that range from artsy projects like using waste materials to create homemade stethoscopes and collages to informative sessions like discussions on inclusion and identity. 

Dr Alexa Ruppertsberg, Head of Public Engagement with Research, said: “What a journey the past year has been! We’ve gone from a postponed Be Curious 2020 in March to adapting to a completely new format.

“The Public Engagement team was eager to give our academics and researchers opportunities to inspire wonder, help with sensemaking and challenge long-held views.

“Be Curious will also encourage participation and involvement to influence behaviours – and nourish natural curiosity with the public in these changed times.”

In addition to live events, explore 2-minute wow demonstrations, experiments, demos and explainer videos [via the Be Curious YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEqI4wfi6ycMg4PgxXViXADFcXaEPLw5%5d).

All events are free to attend upon registration. [Check out the Be Curious site](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/becurious) for the full schedule of events and links to sign up.
