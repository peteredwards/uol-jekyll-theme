# This file contains the main site navigation.
#
# There are four main navigation areas:
#
#   quicklinks - these are the menus at the top of the page in the black header
#   main - this is the main menu shown below the black header
#   section - this is a menu which can be turned on and off for different pages and can be used for contextual navigation
#   footer - the footer has three menu areas in columns and another in the bottom band of the site
#
# All navigation items have a title and either have an items collection (for a nested menu) or a url

# Quicklinks are placed in the black header at the top of each page
# This menu must only be nested one level deep.

# Main menu placed under the black header
# This menu must only be nested one level deep. Items on the nested level can also have a cta property which will change the link's appearance

# Section menu
# The section menu is located to the left of content on larger screens and forms a dropdown on smaller screens
# So different pages can be in different sections, each menu has a name, and is referred to in page front matter
# like this:

# sectionmenu: sectionname

#    items:

# Section Calls to action
# These are located under the section menu to the left of content on larger screens and under the page content on
# smaller screens. So different pages can be in different sections, each menu has a name, and is referred to in 
# page front matter like this:

# sectionctas: sectionctaname

#  sectionctaname:
#    title: 
#    items:
#      - title: 
#        url:

# Footer Information consists of links to key pages on the site.
# Each site should have its own Accessibility and Privacy pages
# and may well have a Terms and Conditions page and Copyright
# Page. You can also link to the University FOI page here.
