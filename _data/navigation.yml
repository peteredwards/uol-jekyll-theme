# This file contains the main site navigation.
#
# There are four main navigation areas:
#
#   quicklinks - these are the menus at the top of the page in the black header
#   main       - this is the main menu shown below the black header
#   section    - this is a menu which can be turned on and off for different
#                pages and can be used for contextual navigation
#   footer     - the footer has three menu areas in columns and another in the
#                bottom band of the site
#
# All navigation items have a title and either have an items collection (for 
# a nested menu) or a url.
