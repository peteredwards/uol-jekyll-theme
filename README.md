# University of Leeds Jekyll Theme

Jekyll theme based on the [University of Leeds Design System](https://designsystem.leeds.ac.uk).

## Theme features

The theme contains the following page layouts

* [Home page](https://github.com/peteredwards/uol-jekyll-theme/wiki/Home-page) - this is the most complex and is used for building home pages or landing pages for sections of the site. All content in this template must be placed in data files or front matter.
* [Page](https://github.com/peteredwards/uol-jekyll-theme/wiki/Page) - this template is really simple but can contain complex content like tables and accordions.
* [Post](https://github.com/peteredwards/uol-jekyll-theme/wiki/Post) - this is the main template for blog posts.
* [List](https://github.com/peteredwards/uol-jekyll-theme/wiki/List) - this displays multiple blog posts.

The [University of Leeds Design System](https://designsystem.leeds.ac.uk) contains multiple [menu systems](https://github.com/peteredwards/uol-jekyll-theme/wiki/Menus) and areas on pages which can be configured to appear sitewide, in groups of pages, or on single pages. The design was built to cater for a large amount of content!
